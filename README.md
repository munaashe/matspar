## Getting Started
First, install the node modules:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Second, Open [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) with your browser and click (Request temporary access to the demo server).


I had to uses cors-anywhere to access the server from my localhost, which is also the reason why I did not deploy to Vercel

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
